Project Overview
This project applies Business Intelligence (BI) and Analytics techniques on the Classic Models Database to extract actionable insights. The project includes:

Descriptive Analytics: Analyzing top customers, sales trends, and top-selling products.
Predictive Analytics: Customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and demand prediction using linear regression.
Text Analytics: Topic modeling on customer feedback to uncover common themes.
The insights gained from the analysis can be used for decision-making in customer segmentation, product promotions, and operational improvements.

Features
Descriptive Analytics:

Top customers by credit limit.
Monthly sales trends analysis.
Top-selling products analysis based on revenue.
Predictive Analytics:

Customer Segmentation: Using K-Means clustering on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features.
Product Demand Prediction: Linear regression model for predicting demand based on price.
Text Analytics:

Topic Modeling: Analyzing customer comments with LDA (Latent Dirichlet Allocation) to uncover recurring topics.
Word clouds generated for each topic.
Data Persistence:

RFM clusters and topic modeling results are saved in a MySQL database for further analysis.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn, nltk, wordcloud
Database: MySQL
BI Techniques: SQL, Machine Learning (Clustering, Regression), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Topic Modeling (LDA)
